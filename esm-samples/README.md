# @arcgis/core (ES modules)

The sample projects in this directory integrate the [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) build of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript with various frameworks, module bundlers and build tools. `@arcgis/core` is installed locally using NPM.

For TypeScript users, the type definitions are included with the API. There is no need for a separate install.

For additional information, see the [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) Guide topic in the SDK.
